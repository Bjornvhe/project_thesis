The four scripts used in generatingg ddms for the project thesis: GNSS-Reflectometry for detection of oil platforms


Several of the scripts are not runnable without setting up local triton files in a correct format.
I have used the location of the files as: basepath + data\YYYYMMDD\ + 'filename ending with _nc'
